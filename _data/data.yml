    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently a system architect at MangoBoost Inc. 
      I completed my Ph.D. at Yonsei University, Korea, with a dissertation titled 
      "GPU Architecture Design for Effective Computing Resource Usage" 
      under the guidance of Professor [Won Woo Ro](http://escal.yonsei.ac.kr/). 
      My expertise lies in designing computer architectures 
      from general-purpose processing units to domain-specific accelerators, 
      with a focus on optimizing computing resource utilization. 
      My recent work focuses on optimizing GPUs' computing resource usage 
      and democratizing various domain-specific accelerators.
      My current focus involves exploring RDMA engine architecture for [MangoBoost](https://www.mangoboost.io/) DPUs.
      - Fast learner
      - Independent and highly motivated
      - Highly reliable team player or leader
      - Professional communication, writing, and presentation skills
